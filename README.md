This is my first python module and currently I can not recommend the general public to use it. However I have used it intensivley in the past.

I recommend using everything discussed in the tutorial:
 - Hamiltonian
 - plotting
 - observables

Not tested modules:
 - methods_analysis
 - methods_basic
 - methods_topological
 - MF_analysis
 - mean_field
